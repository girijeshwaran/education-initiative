# Design Patterns Demo in Java

## Problem
This project demonstrates common **design patterns** in Java using real-world application-oriented examples.  
It includes behavioral, creational, and structural patterns to illustrate practical usage in software development.

## Features
- **Observer Pattern** → Notify customers when a product is back in stock  
- **Strategy Pattern** → Dynamically select payment method (Credit Card, PayPal)  
- **Singleton Pattern** → Ensure only one shopping cart instance exists  
- **Factory Pattern** → Create products dynamically (Electronics, Clothing)  
- **Decorator Pattern** → Add features to products dynamically (Gift Wrap, Extended Warranty)  
- **Adapter Pattern** → Use an external shipping service with incompatible interface  

## Design Patterns Used
- **Observer** – For customer notifications  
- **Strategy** – For payment method selection  
- **Singleton** – For shopping cart  
- **Factory** – For dynamic product creation  
- **Decorator** – For dynamically adding product features  
- **Adapter** – For integrating external shipping service 

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the `src` folder:
      bash``` cd src```
2. Compile all Java files:
      bash```javac */*/*.java Main.java```
3. Run the application:
      bash```java Main```
